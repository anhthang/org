Are you using [Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and working with XML builder tools day by day?

XML to JSON can help you create the final object, just edit the variables that need dynamic data instead of typing each object key, attribute and no typos mistake. Converted data can be use for [xmlbuilder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmlbuilder), [xml2js](https://npmjs.com/package/xml2js) or your expected format using configuration options.

Here are just some of the features that XML to JSON provides:
