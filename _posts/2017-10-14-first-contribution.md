Few months ago, I created a small project called _pino-redis_, a "transport" for the pino logger, receives [pino] logs from `stdin` and transform them into Redis.

Yesterday, I decided add it into official transports documentation via PR [#307]. And now, it was there.

It's my first contribution to the open source community. You can find via [npm] or [GitHub]
