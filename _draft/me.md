### Hey, I'm Thang
I'm working as a Software Engineer at KMSoft, a company based in Hanoi, VN. I graduated from Academy of Finance, Vietnam but I love working on the software development.

Beside that, I like reading book, travelling and taking the pictures and typing with mechanical keyboard.

### Now, I have this blog
where I share what I have learned or I found interesting. It can also be some trick, walk-through from the games I'm playing (Pok√©mon, Harvest Moon, Kirby series), beautiful pictures that I have taken.

### Also, you can find me
on Twitter as [@anhthangbui][twitter] or Instagram as [anhthangbui][instagram]
