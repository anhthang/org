### Hey, I'm Thang
I'm working as a Node.js developer at GoQuo, based in Hanoi, VN.

I graduated from Academy of Finance, Vietnam and I had a difficult year starting this job with C#, but it's getting better now since I move to Node.js 2 years ago.

### Now, I have this blog
where I share what I have learned or I found interesting. It can also be some trick, walk-through from the games I'm playing (Pok√©mon, Harvest Moon, Kirby series), beautiful pictures that I have taken.

### Also, you can find me
on Twitter as [@anhthangbui][twitter] or Instagram as [anhthangbui][instagram]
